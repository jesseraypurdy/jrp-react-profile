							When I want to learn or practice something I typically do so
							by writing something game related. Game-dev really allows me
							to touch on many areas of the tech in question, and most importantly:
							It's incredibly fun. I spent a few days developing a TypeScript powered
							{" "}{roguelikeWikiPage} engine built on top of the Rot.js framework. It is very much a work in progress
							and a bit of a mess now, but for a small weekend project, I'm not too fussed ðŸ˜‹. Most of
							of my game-dev projects are not open source. This is one of the exceptions. Run into some walls {typeScriptRoguelikePageLink}.

							I've been wanting to try out Monogame with Nez and
							decided a simple game would not only allow me to get
							my hands dirty with the framework and engine, but
							would also act as a way to showcase my proficiency
							with C#/.Net. I wrote Neztris over the course of a
							few days without the use of guides or tutorials,
							while learning how Monogame and Nez work. With that
							said this isn't a masterpiece. However, it is a
							functional and even playable Tetris clone. So{" "}
							{neztrisLink} you have it!

							This site is my first web project. The development
							process allowed me to get familiar with HTML5, CSS,
							Javascript, and even some visual design.
							Additionally, I learned about the deployment process
							using Heroku. The front-end is built on top of
							React, and I handled the (small) back-end with
							Node.js and Express. For styling I opted to use
							styled-components and the fantastic{" "}
							{styledSystemLink} package. This project taught me a lot about web development.
							I'm happy to have started, and finished it. ðŸ˜Š
							Update: I have since moved this project to GitHub
							Pages for ease of maintenance. The above still applies
							though.

							Moku is an open source Map utility/module for the
							Defold game engine. It was written as an exercise in
							Lua, and provides out-of-the-box autotiling, as well
							as powerful and efficient pathfinding. Complete
							documentation is available. Moku was featured by
							both the makers of Defold (King Games), as well as
							Games From Scratch. Follow the {mokuLink} for a
							demo!
