							After graduating at Kapiʻolani I immediatly enrolled in the University of Hawaii's
							mathematics program. Here I learned the skills necessary to understand and work with
							advanced concepts in mathematics. Some of the courses I took such as differential equations,
							linear algebra, and probability theory were mostly application based. Whereas others such as
							abstract algebra, real analysis, and topology were very heavily focused on theory and
							proofs. In the end the most important skill I learned in the persuit of this degree was to
							think analytically. Even in every day situations I often find myself “thinking like a
							mathematician.”

							I enrolled in KCC with such a lack of knowledge in math that I was required to take
							introductory, pre-college-level algebra courses. However, after overcoming my fear of
							mathematics and working my way up to the calculus level, I was able to enter the schools
							exceptional STEM program. There I took part in physics, chemistry, ICS, and biology courses.
							Kapiʻolani's amazing faculty promoted in me the idea that I could excel in anything I put my
							mind to, including my former nemesis mathematics which I ultimatly, and perhaps ironically,
							decided to major in.
